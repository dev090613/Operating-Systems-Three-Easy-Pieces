## Homework (Code)

In this homework, you are to gain some familiarity with the process management APIs about which you just read. Don’t worry – it’s even more fun than it sounds! You’ll in general be much better off if you find as much time as you can to write some code, so why not start now?

### Questions

1. Write a program that calls `fork()`. Before calling `fork()`, have the main process access a variable (e.g., `x`) and set its value to something (e.g., `100`). What value is the variable in the child process? What happens to the variable when both the child and parent change the value of `x`?

   - The value is the variable in the child process. 

   - They both change the value in their own process.

2. Write a program that opens a file (with the `open()` system call) and then calls `fork()` to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by `open()`? What happens when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

   They both can access the file descriptor.

   The final result is up to the system scheduler.

3. Write another program using `fork()`. The child process should print “hello”; the parent process should print “goodbye”. You should try to ensure that the child process always prints first; can you do this *without* calling **wait()** in the parent?

   - Using `kill()` to send `SIGCONT` signal to parent process.

   - Read from `pipe`.

4. Write a program that calls `fork()` and then calls some form of `exec()` to
   run the program `/bin/ls`. See if you can try all of the variants of `exec()`, including(on Linux)`execl()`, `execle()`, `execlp()`, `execv()`, `execvp()`, and `execvpe()`. Why do you think there are so many variants of the same basic call?

    - [exec (system call): C language prototypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_(system_call)#C_language_prototypes)

5. Now write a program that uses `wait()` to wait for the child process to finish in the parent. What does `wait()` return? What happens if you use `wait()` in the child?

   - On success, returns the process ID(`pid_t`) of the terminated child; on error, -1 is returned.

   - Returns -1.

6. Write a slight modification of the previous program,this time using `waitpid()` instead of wait(). When would `waitpid()` be useful?

   - If Parent process is waiting for Any / Specific child Process to terminate.
   - If you might want to know if a child process terminated normally or was killed by a signal.

7. Write a program that creates a child process, and then in the child closes standard output (`STDOUT_FILENO`). What happens if the child calls `printf()` to print some output after closing the descriptor?

   - The result of `printf()` won't show in the terminal.

8. Write a program that creates two children, and connects the standard output of one to the standard input of the other, using the `pipe()` system call.
